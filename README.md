docker-puppetserver
===================

An ill-documented Docker image that runs the latest Puppet 4 Server from the RHEL 7 Puppet Labs repository.

## Run It

Running it is as simple as:

```
sudo docker run -it -p 8140:8140 rfkrocktk/puppetserver:2.4.0-2
```

As simple as that. Default values are assumed mirroring the SystemD unit provided by Puppet Labs, meaning that the JVM
will allocate 2 GiB of minimum and maximum heap size. This can be tweaked with the `JAVA_ARGS` environment variable:

```
sudo docker run -it -p 8140:8140 -e JAVA_ARGS="-Xms4g -Xmx4g" rfkrocktk/puppetserver:2.4.0-2
```

Drop in configuration using Docker volume mounts to your host. Files should be owned by the `puppet` user which has UID
of `52`. The Puppet Server will run as `puppet` with reduced privileges because I like to sleep at night.

## Getting Shell

If you need to acquire shell to your Puppet Server to e.g. sign certificates, this can be easily done by naming your
container on start:

```
sudo docker run --name puppetserver --hostname puppetserver -p 8140:8140 \
    rfkrocktk/puppetserver:2.4.0-2
```

Now that the container is running, we can acquire a shell using the Docker `exec` command:

```
$ sudo docker exec -it puppetserver bash
[root@puppetserver /]# echo "I am G$(test $EUID == 0 && echo root || id -n)"
```

Sign away, young champion.

### Versioning

We are following Puppet's own package versioning with one caveat. Instead of following their package's RPM release
version, we introduce an `IMAGE_RELEASE` environment variable as a release version. This value _may_ correspond to the
RPM package's release version or may not. The reason given is that if a security bug is introduced in a dependent
system library (e.g. [Heartbleed][heartbleed], [the GNU libc bug][glibc-bug], etc.), we can bump this value and have the
image rebuilt using the latest dependencies.

This works because upon bumping the version, Docker will invalidate the cache and start the image build from that
position:

```
ENV IMAGE_RELEASE=1
# upgrade all packages
RUN yum upgrade -y >/dev/null
```

If/when such a security bug is found, bump the release version and rebuild to upgrade all packages:

```
ENV IMAGE_RELEASE=2
# upgrade all packages
RUN yum upgrade -y >/dev/null
```
